Here is a simple application which makes use of Kernel timers and the Gnome libnotify library.This pr
ogram reminds you to take rest at intervals while you are sitting in front of your linux box. :).Run "m
ake" to have the executable. This executable have to be started in the beggining so that it reminds y
ou automatically.I am really sorry,I am yet to write an installation script for it.

Note : countDown() in lib/timer.h is same as standard system call alarm()
